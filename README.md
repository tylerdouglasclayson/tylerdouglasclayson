##### About Me:  
Hello, my name is Tyler Clayson. I'm currently a student at Utah State University in Logan, UT and am about to begin the last semester of my masters degree 
in data analytics with an emphasis in MIS. My undergrad was in statistics with a minor mathematics at the same university. 

##### Included in the Repo: 
This github account is something I have created on my own and it will undoubtedly take me a moment to organize. Code contained here is:
- The capstone project from my masters degree which is the beginning of a crop identification program that uses satellite imagery. 
- Any completed machine learning models I have created so I can maintain notes for myself to fall back on in the future. 
If this is of use to you, I'm glad it could help!

You can reach out to me at clayson.tyler96@gmail.com and just be sure to title it GitHub repo so I know what the message is based on. 

##### CaliforniaHousingModel
Machine learning competition from the Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

Summary: Predicting housing prices in California based on details about the property using machine learning models. 

Uses the following machine learning models via sklearn library:
Linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors classifier, naive bayes gaussian, support vector machine, decision tree, MLP, and perceptron. 

##### breastCancerWisconsin
Machine learning practice from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/gargmanish/basic-machine-learning-with-cancer

Summary: Predicting the diagnosis (malignant or benign) of a cell mass based on characteristics of the mass found in 3-d imaging. 

Uses standardscaler for faster learning and the following ML models via sklearn:
Logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, naive bayes gaussian, perceptron, linear support vector machine, decision tree, random forest
