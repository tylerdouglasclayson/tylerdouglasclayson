##### About Me:  
Hello, my name is Tyler Clayson. I'm currently a student at Utah State University in Logan, UT and am about to begin the last semester of my masters degree 
in data analytics with an emphasis in MIS. My undergrad was in statistics with a minor mathematics at the same university. 

##### Included in the Repo: 
This github account is something I have created on my own and it will undoubtedly take me a moment to organize. Code contained here is:
- The capstone project from my masters degree which is the beginning of a crop identification program that uses satellite imagery. 
- Any completed machine learning models I have created so I can maintain notes for myself to fall back on in the future. 
If this is of use to you, I'm glad it could help!

You can reach out to me at clayson.tyler96@gmail.com and just be sure to title it GitHub repo so I know what the message is based on.
