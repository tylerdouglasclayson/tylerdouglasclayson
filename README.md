### About Me:  
Hello, my name is Tyler Clayson. I'm currently a student at Utah State University in Logan, UT and am about to begin the last semester of my masters degree 
in data analytics with an emphasis in MIS. My undergrad was in statistics with a minor mathematics at the same university. 

I created this repo to keep track of previous work I've made in the field of data science. It will be something that I feel can be beneficial to my resume, but also a great place for me to fall back on notes or methods I've used in the past that are written in my own hand (so to speak). 

If any of this is of use to you, I'm glad it could help!
You can reach out to me at clayson.tyler96@gmail.com and just be sure to title it GitHub repo so I know what the message is about. 

### Included in the Repo: 
#### CropIdentification
Written in python code

This is from the capstone project of my masters degree at Utah State University.

By using line detection in tandom with green detection with the help of two others in my class, we were able to roughly create a python code that could be used to detect crops from satellite images. 

#### CaliforniaHousingModel
Written in python code

Machine learning practice from Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

Summary: Predicting housing prices in California based on details about the property using machine learning models. 

Uses the following machine learning models via sklearn library:
Linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors classifier, naive bayes gaussian, support vector machine, decision tree, MLP, and perceptron. 

#### breastCancerWisconsin
Written in python code

Machine learning practice from Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/code/gargmanish/basic-machine-learning-with-cancer

Summary: Predicting the diagnosis (malignant or benign) of a cell mass based on characteristics of the mass found in 3-d imaging. 

Uses standardscaler for faster learning and the following ML models via sklearn:
Logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, naive bayes gaussian, perceptron, linear support vector machine, decision tree, random forest

#### bankruptcyPrediction
Written in python notebook

Machine learning practice from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/eliqulu/company-bankruptcy-prediction

Summary: This dataset uses values taken from a Taiwan economic journal, and uses information to predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt. 

Uses robust scaling, and demonstrates how to make predictions if you wanted to test and see if a company outside of the dataset was likely to go bankrupt. 

#### StatsNotes
This file is purely for me to use as a reference about ML and statistical learning models that can refresh my memory as succinctly as possible. It is written with my own interpretation, and should not be substituted for professional works.
